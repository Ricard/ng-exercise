        You can find a new location that lazy load the user-list mopdule:
        <a href="#/users-list">
          Users list
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        As usual, the HTTP request for retrieving users is done by a service. The results are only retrieved one time and stored
        in this singleton.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The component
        <a href="#/users-list">
          Users list
        </a>
        is navigating to user detail component.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking the advantage of a service, to retrieve a user information does not requiere a new http request. The service is able
        to return all the users list or just only one.
      </p>

        Regarding to styles, I have to explain that I didn't introduced any CSS framework but just copyed some W3 schools CSS
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/">
          https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/
        </a>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The solution could be found in
        <a href="#/home">
          home section
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many approaches for comunication between components. Frequently it is requiered a service but in this case I decided to handle the comunication from the parent component as you suggest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each component have a boolean variable that represents the login status. I decided to change the component for accepting a input, therefore parent is able to change the components login status.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the other hand, each component will notify its login status by a output stream. When this output have a new value, the parent store it in the same variable that is an input for the other component.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

        I didn't had much free time to enhance this solution but it was a pleasure to follow this excercices ðŸ¤™
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>My apologies</b>
        because I didn't followed the TDD practice, so finally I did no tests of the service (where there are some logic)
